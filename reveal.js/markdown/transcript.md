Figuring out that a flexible, high-paying career as a web developer is the dream is the easy part.Where it gets harder is figuring out exactly what skills you need to land a job. If you’re planningon building websites for a living, you probably know you’ll need to learn coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but you’ll also notice developer job listings that call for less familiar skills One buzzy skill you’ll see pop up is “React JS.” But what is React JS? Is it another codinglanguage? A software program? Or something totally different?To answer your questions and get you up to speed with this valuable web developer tool, we’ve put together a handy What is React JS tutorial.</p>
<h2>2 page </h2>
<p>	React JS is a JavaScript library used in web development to build interactive elements on
	websites. But if you’re not familiar with JavaScript or JavaScript libraries, that’s not a
   helpful definition. So let’s take a step back and deal with those terms first.</p>
<h2>3 page </h2><p>
JavaScript is a super important coding language used to add animated and interactive features to
websites or web applications (on top of the basic, static structures created by languages like
HTML and CSS).
 From the definition above, you can see how JavaScript plays a critical role in website and web
						application development. But there are times when you need JavaScript to perform repetitive
						functions—things like stock animation effects or autocomplete search bar features. Re-coding
						these functions every time they occur becomes a “reinventing the wheel” situation. Annnnoying.
						This is where JavaScript libraries come in.
    					JavaScript libraries are collections of pre-written JavaScript code that can be used for common
    					JS tasks, allowing you to bypass the time intensive (and unnecessary) process of coding by hand.
    					If there’s a run-of-the-mill JavaScript function that you keep needing to code (and that other
    					developers before you have needed for their own projects) there’s probably a JS library to ease
    					your pain. Make sense?
    					OK, so let’s get back to React. There are a lot of different JS libraries out there and React JS
    					is one of them—but what makes it unique? What is React JS used for, and why should you learn
    					React JS? And is it better than other JavaScript libraries?</p>
<h2>4 page </h2><p>
	React is a JavaScript library that specializes in helping developers build user interfaces, or UIs.
					In terms of websites and web applications, UIs are the collection of on-screen menus, search bars,
					buttons, and anything else someone interacts with to USE a website or app.Before React JS,
					developers were stuck building UIs by hand with “vanilla JavaScript” (developer speak for the raw
					JavaScript language on its own) or with less UI-focused React predecessors like jQuery. That meant
					longer development times and plenty of opportunities for errors and bugs. So, in 2011, Facebook
					engineer Jordan Walke created React JS specifically to improve UI development.</p>
<h2>5 page </h2><p>
	In addition to providing reusable React library code (saving development time and cutting down
						on the chance for coding errors), React comes with two key features that add to its appeal
						for
						developers:<br>-JSX <br>-Virtual DOM</p>
<h2>6 page </h2><p>
At the heart of any basic website are HTML documents. Web browsers read these documents and
						display them on your computer, tablet, or phone as web pages. During this process, browsers
						create something called a Document Object Model (DOM), a representational tree of how the web
						page is arranged. Developers can then add dynamic content to their projects by modifying the DOM
						with languages like JavaScript.
    					JSX (short for JavaScript eXtension) is a React extension that makes it easy for web developers
    					to modify their DOM by using simple, HTML-style code. And—since React JS browser support extends
    					to all modern web browsers—JSX is compatible with any browser platform you might be working
    					with.
    					This isn’t just a matter of convenience, though—using JSX to update a DOM leads to significant
    					site performance improvements and development efficiency. How? It’s all about the next React
    					feature, the Virtual DOM.</p>

<h2>7 page </h2><p>
However, if a developer uses JSX to manipulate and update its DOM, React JS creates something
						called a Virtual DOM. The Virtual DOM (like the name implies) is a copy of the site’s DOM, and
						React JS uses this copy to see what parts of the actual DOM need to change when an event happens
						(like a user clicking a button).
						Let’s say a user enters a comment in a blog post form and pushes the “Comment” button. Without
						using React JS, the entire DOM would have to update to reflect this change (using the time and
						processing power it takes to make this update). React, on the other hand, scans the Virtual DOM
						to see what changed after a user action (in this case, a comment being added) and selectively
						updates that section of the DOM only.
						This kind of selective updating takes less computing power and less loading time, which might
						not sound like much when you’re talking about a single blog comment, but—when you start to think
						about all the dynamics and updating associated with even a slightly complex website—you’ll
						realize it adds up to a lot.<p>
