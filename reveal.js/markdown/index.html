					Figuring out that a flexible, high-paying career as a web developer is the dream is the easy part.
					Where it gets harder is figuring out exactly what skills you need to land a job. If you’re planning
					on building websites for a living, you probably know you’ll need to learn coding languages like
					HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but you’ll also notice developer job listings that call for less familiar
					skills.

					One buzzy skill you’ll see pop up is “React JS.” But what is React JS? Is it another coding
					language? A software program? Or something totally different?

					To answer your questions and get you up to speed with this valuable web developer tool, we’ve put
					together a handy What is React JS tutorial.

					From the definition above, you can see how JavaScript plays a critical role in website and web
					application development. But there are times when you need JavaScript to perform repetitive
					functions—things like stock animation effects or autocomplete search bar features. Re-coding these
					functions every time they occur becomes a “reinventing the wheel” situation. Annoying. This is
					where JavaScript libraries come in.

						HTML and CSS).

						JavaScript libraries are collections of pre-written JavaScript code that can be used for common
						JS tasks, allowing you to bypass the time intensive (and unnecessary) process of coding by hand.
						If there’s a run-of-the-mill JavaScript function that you keep needing to code (and that other
						developers before you have needed for their own projects) there’s probably a JS library to ease
						your pain. Make sense?

						OK, so let’s get back to React. There are a lot of different JS libraries out there and React JS
						is one of them—but what makes it unique? What is React JS used for, and why should you learn
						React JS? And is it better than other JavaScript libraries?

				React is a JavaScript library
				that specializes in
				helping developers
				build user interfaces, or UIs.
				In terms of websites and web applications, UIs are the collection of on-screen menus, search bars,
				buttons, and anything else someone interacts with to USE a website or app.

					React is a JavaScript library that specializes in helping developers build user interfaces, or UIs.
					In terms of websites and web applications, UIs are the collection of on-screen menus, search bars,

					developers were stuck building UIs by hand with “vanilla JavaScript” (developer speak for the raw
					JavaScript language on its own) or with less UI-focused React predecessors like jQuery. That meant
					longer development times and plenty of opportunities for errors and bugs. So, in 2011, Facebook
					engineer Jordan Walke created React JS specifically to improve UI development.

				<section data-auto-animate data-background="#4E3D42" style="color: aliceblue">JSX (short for JavaScript
					extension) is a React
					extension that makes it easy for web developers to modify their DOM by using simple, HTML-style
					code. And—since React JS browser support extends to all modern web browsers—JSX is compatible with
					any browser platform you might be working with.
					<pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
						const name = 'Josh Perez';
						const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {name}&lt;/h1&gt;;
						
						ReactDOM.render(

					<aside class="notes">
						At the heart of any basic website are HTML documents. Web browsers read these documents and
						display them on your computer, tablet, or phone as web pages. During this process, browsers
						create something called a Document Object Model (DOM), a representational tree of how the web
						page is arranged. Developers can then add dynamic content to their projects by modifying the DOM
						with languages like JavaScript.

						JSX (short for JavaScript eXtension) is a React extension that makes it easy for web developers
						to modify their DOM by using simple, HTML-style code. And—since React JS browser support extends
						to all modern web browsers—JSX is compatible with any browser platform you might be working
						with.

						This isn’t just a matter of convenience, though—using JSX to update a DOM leads to significant
						site performance improvements and development efficiency. How? It’s all about the next React
						feature, the Virtual DOM.

				<section style="font-size: 30px;">
					However, if a developer uses JSX to manipulate and update its DOM, React JS creates something
					called a Virtual DOM. The Virtual DOM (like the name implies) is a copy of the site’s DOM, and
					React JS uses this copy to see what parts of the actual DOM need to change when an event happens
					(like a user clicking a button).

					Let’s say a user enters a comment in a blog post form and pushes the “Comment” button. Without
					using React JS, the entire DOM would have to update to reflect this change (using the time and
					processing power it takes to make this update). React, on the other hand, scans the Virtual DOM
					to see what changed after a user action (in this case, a comment being added) and selectively
					updates that section of the DOM only.
